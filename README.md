 # No Invis Death Message (FABRIC)

[>DOWNLOAD<](https://github.com/KWAKZ5/No-Invis-Death-Message/releases)

Removes the name of the killer if invisible. It also removes invisibility from users who other players damage.

This is my first "real" fabric mod. It took me about 5 days, on and off, to make but I got there in the end.

This mod is under the CC0 1.0 Universal license, so you can do anything to or with it.

I will not update this mod. This was a small one time project. Feel free to do it yourself
