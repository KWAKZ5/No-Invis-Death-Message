# No Invis Death Message
Removes the name of the killer if invisible. It also removes invisibility from users who other players damage.

This is my first "real" fabric mod. It took me about 5 days to make but I got there in the end.

This mod is under the CC0 1.0 Universal license, so you can do anything to or with it.

Please report any bugs. I WILL NOT DOWNGRADE THIS MOD OR MAKE A FORGE VERSION FOR IT.
